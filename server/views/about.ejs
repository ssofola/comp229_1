            <p>I am a highly experienced ICT expert with over 10 years of industry experience. I have worked for all
                sizes of organizations ranging from Individuals, Large Corporates to African Government Agencies. No
                work is too small or challenging, the thrill is in solving any problem you throw at me in an
                efficient and elegant manner.

                    I was born in Lagos, Nigeria in the 1970s to a large Yoruba family. My late dad was a Civil
                    Engineer, and my mum was into business and real estate. I did my High School in Kaduna, Nigeria,
                    before proceeding to the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria for my first Degree in
                    Mathematics. I emigrated to South Africa in the 2000s where I studied Computer Science at Wits
                    Univerity in Johannesburg. I moved into Corporate Consulting in 2014 after finishing my MBA at
                    Milpark Business School. I have been in ICT consulting for over 10 years and have been solely
                    focused on projects that use Information Technology to solve customer problems.
